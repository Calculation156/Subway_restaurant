--Conclusion--
This Subway is a fast food restaurant that serve budget-concious customers who prefer healthy meals and the diversity in option.
(1) There are strong flucuations in price that adversely affects customers so it is recommended that Subway optimizes it supply chain to maintain a competitive and stable price for popular options such as Teriyaki chicken or Tuna.
(2) The majority of customers buy at least 2 items from 2 different categories and department. It raise a hypothesis that customers prefer combos of items, some only buy 1 single item due to the financial reason.
A customer survey is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
If the hypothesis is true, sales can be boosted with Bundle purchase discount. In order to run this promotion programme effectively, We will need large data set to run market basket analysis to see what food items are likely to be bought together.
